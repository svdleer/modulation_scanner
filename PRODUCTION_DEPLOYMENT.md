# Production Deployment Summary

## Overview
The Modulation Scanner system has been enhanced with comprehensive process management and watchdog monitoring for reliable production deployment. The system now prevents multiple instances, handles graceful shutdowns, and includes automatic restart capabilities.

## Key Production Features Implemented

### 1. Process Locking & Multi-Instance Prevention
- **File-based exclusive locking** using `fcntl` (Linux) / file handles (Windows)
- **PID file management** (`modulation_scanner.pid`) with process validation
- **Stale lock detection** and cleanup for crashed processes
- **Graceful startup** with existing instance detection

### 2. Signal Handling & Graceful Shutdown
- **SIGTERM/SIGINT handlers** for clean process termination
- **Database connection cleanup** on shutdown
- **Resource cleanup** (files, network connections)
- **Status update** on shutdown events

### 3. Heartbeat Monitoring & Health Tracking
- **Real-time status file** (`modulation_scanner.status`) with JSON format
- **Heartbeat timestamps** updated every scan cycle
- **Health indicators** (running status, uptime, process state)
- **Uptime tracking** with human-readable format

### 4. Watchdog System (`scanner_watchdog.py`)
- **Automatic process monitoring** with configurable heartbeat timeout
- **Failed process detection** based on PID validation and heartbeat age
- **Intelligent restart logic** with retry attempts and delays  
- **Graceful process termination** before restart (SIGTERM → SIGKILL)
- **Comprehensive logging** of all monitoring activities

### 5. Enhanced Maintenance Scripts
- **Updated cron scripts** for both Linux and Windows
- **Watchdog-only mode** for frequent health checks
- **Full maintenance mode** with database cleanup and watchdog check
- **Flexible scheduling** options for different deployment scenarios

## File Structure Created

```
modulation_scanner.py          # Enhanced with process locking & signals
scanner_watchdog.py            # New comprehensive watchdog system  
maintenance_cron.sh            # Updated Linux cron script
maintenance_cron_simple.bat    # New simple Windows batch script
maintenance_cron.bat           # Existing complex Windows script (unchanged)

# Runtime files created automatically:
modulation_scanner.pid         # Process ID with exclusive lock
modulation_scanner.status      # JSON heartbeat and health data
watchdog.log                   # Watchdog monitoring log
maintenance.log                # Maintenance operation log
```

## Process Management Implementation Details

### Scanner Process Lifecycle
1. **Startup**: Check for existing lock, create PID file with exclusive lock
2. **Runtime**: Update status file with heartbeat every scan cycle
3. **Shutdown**: Release lock, cleanup files, close database connections
4. **Signal Handling**: Graceful shutdown on SIGTERM/SIGINT

### Watchdog Monitoring Cycle
1. **Status Check**: Read status file and validate heartbeat age
2. **Process Validation**: Verify PID is still running
3. **Health Assessment**: Check for health indicators and responsiveness
4. **Restart Logic**: If unhealthy, stop process gracefully and restart
5. **Retry Mechanism**: Multiple restart attempts with exponential backoff

### Lock File Management
- **Exclusive locking** prevents multiple instances
- **PID validation** ensures lock belongs to running process
- **Stale lock cleanup** removes locks from dead processes
- **Atomic operations** prevent race conditions

## Deployment Schedules

### Recommended Cron/Task Scheduler Setup

#### Windows Task Scheduler
```
Task 1: "Modulation Scanner Maintenance"
- Schedule: Daily, repeat every 4 hours
- Action: maintenance_cron_simple.bat
- Purpose: Full database maintenance + watchdog check

Task 2: "Modulation Scanner Watchdog" 
- Schedule: Daily, repeat every 5 minutes
- Action: maintenance_cron_simple.bat --watchdog-only
- Purpose: Health monitoring and automatic restart

Optional Task 3: "Web Report Updates"
- Schedule: Daily, repeat every 15 minutes  
- Action: python report_modulation.py --json-only
- Purpose: Frequent web interface updates
```

#### Linux Cron
```bash
# Full maintenance every 4 hours
0 */4 * * * /path/to/maintenance_cron.sh

# Watchdog check every 5 minutes
*/5 * * * * /path/to/maintenance_cron.sh --watchdog-only

# Web report updates every 15 minutes (optional)
*/15 * * * * cd /path && python report_modulation.py --json-only
```

## Configuration Options

### Watchdog Settings (scanner_watchdog.py)
```python
max_heartbeat_age = 300      # 5 minutes max heartbeat age
max_restart_attempts = 3     # Maximum restart attempts
restart_delay = 30           # Seconds between restart attempts
```

### Scanner Settings (modulation_scanner.py)
```python
# Process management is automatic, but configurable via:
# - Lock file location
# - Status file location  
# - Heartbeat update frequency
# - Signal handler behavior
```

## Operational Commands

### Manual Management
```bash
# Check status and restart if needed (normal operation)
python scanner_watchdog.py

# Show detailed status report
python scanner_watchdog.py --status

# Force start scanner (if stopped)
python scanner_watchdog.py --start

# Stop scanner gracefully
python scanner_watchdog.py --stop

# Start scanner normally (with locking)
python modulation_scanner.py
```

### Log Monitoring
```bash
# View watchdog activity
tail -f watchdog.log

# View maintenance logs
tail -f maintenance.log

# Check scanner status file
cat modulation_scanner.status
```

## Production Benefits

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Test the system** in your environment:
   ```bash
   python scanner_watchdog.py --status
   python modulation_scanner.py
   ```

2. **Set up scheduled tasks** using the provided scripts
3. **Monitor logs** for the first few days to ensure smooth operation  
4. **Adjust configurations** as needed for your specific environment
5. **Set up log rotation** to prevent disk space issues
